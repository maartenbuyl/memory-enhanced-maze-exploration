# memory-enhanced-maze-exploration
Code for master's thesis project: "Memory-enhanced Reinforcement Learning for Maze Exploration" at Ghent University.

Some files are missing for simulating the environment. Their author, Emilio Parisotto, provided them privately in relation with his paper "Neural Map: Structured Memory for Deep Reinforcement Learning" and asked not to distribute these files.

This repository will not be updated.
